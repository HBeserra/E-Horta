This is academic work. I and my group have created this work. Below the list of collaborators and emvolvidos.
I am a student, worried about the last economic crises in which the price of many foods went up I decided to look for a solution to this problem with the use of technology.

Develop a technology to automate day-to-day activities in a garden and monitor its development. My part in this project was to develop the software and hardware solutions, having as priority the low cost of the project.

With this document I intend to help anyone who wants to develop similar projects or to carry out this same step with the steps and especially all the codes used.
